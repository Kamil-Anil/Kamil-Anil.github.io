>"*we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.*" (Truman Show)

Here, to make this website more personal:) I want to share some movies, books and everything else which I am impressed and I would like to talk about with my personal comments. Of course, since personal tastes changes with new experiences, I am planning make updates from time to time. And I'm always open for any suggestions, idea or valuable comments. 

For that, you can contact me via my mail: ***kamilanil15@gmail.com*** 

Movies
======

**WALL-E**

One of my favorite animated movies of all time! Over the years I have watched couple times, and everytime Wall-E's storytelling style really impresses me. About first 30-40 minutes, there is no even single dialogue in movie, just one single robot with two eyes and body trying to do its mission in Earth. But still without any meaningful dialogue, Wall-E is able to reflects more emotions, charachter development (by using just motions of eyes and body) than most of films. I guess, that is not nothing but quite unique example of storytelling. Story in Wall-E is also interesting and valueable in terms of message it carries from beginning to end. Earth is full of trash, humanity lost its identity because of addiction to technology-convenience, importance and meaning of a life and more.

Just briefly, I think this animation is a product come out from creative, innovator and passionate minds. Nowadays, unfortunately I can not see such animations so much thats another why Wall-E is unique and will remain so.
                

**Arrival**

While saying sci-fi movies, most of people thinks of movies such as Interstellar,2001 Space Odyssey, Star Wars. Altough they are also pretty good movies, I think *Arrival* is not well-known and a bit underrated movie. Actually I am not sure also Arrival is completely belong to sci-fi genre. For me, its cover is seems quite sci-fi but it is about importance of communication and how communication affects our understanding of surroundings and time. This is actually what differs Arrival from its counterparts: It uses sci-fi objects like aliens, spaceships as a tool to tell a tragedy of a charachter,mother.

Altough pace of movie is slow, it is not boring because what you see (cinematography) or hear (especially, sound design!) in movie is amazing. Movie uses sounds to support scenes cleverly and masterfully. Here is my favorite [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InyT9Gyoz_o). Another what I like also about Arrival is finally but really finally aliens do not come to earth to conququer or to fight people.   


**Truman Show**

Unparallel, bizarre and paranoid! I dont know what I can say about Truman Show without giving spoilers. But I want to mention it since script of Truman Show might be best I've seen. I remember that while watching Truman Show first time. I shocked so many times and asked such questions: why, what happened, who are they? Reason isn't that movie is not understandable and complex, I asked because I am fascinated by world which movie created. Then I watched it over and over again and everytime I could find new perspectives, details. Thats why probably Truman Show is a movie I've watched most. And last thing I want to say is that Truman Show's ending is just remarkable and excellent.

If anyone is interested, I recommend to watch movie without looking subject and trailer of the movie. Thus, you will also wonder how to be sure you do not spend your life like Truman Burbank. And If you have answer, I would like to hear that! 
 
**Empire Strikes Back**

Star Wars is massive fictional universe including some quite well stories and some quite worst stories. I think over the years it lost its spirit and new movies become just bad copies of old ones. So, if I looked history of that universe and choose one movie to remember, I would use my chance for Empire Strikes Back, second movie of original trilogy. While original trilogy itself was grounbreaking for sci-fi genre, among original movies Empire Strikes Back stands alone at the top. Its one of the best (for me, best one) sequal movie of all time. It carries story to another level and it presents most remarkable villan of cinema history with simple but impressive character relationships.

Here another thing I want to mention is John Williams legend himself. He is composer of Empire Strikes Back, most of other Star Wars movies, Jaws, Schindler's List, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park ... To me, his works ([Star Wars Theme](https://youtu.be/54hoKbTWon4?list=TLPQMDgwMjIwMjTo4aElJ9mEBg)) is another feature makes Empire Strikes Back unforgettable and phonomeonal.
