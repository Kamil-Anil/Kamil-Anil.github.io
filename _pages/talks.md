Movies

**WALL-E**

One of my favorite animated movies of all time! Over the years I have watched couple times, and everytime Wall-E's storytelling style really impresses me. About first 30-40 minutes, there is no even single dialogue in movie, just one single robot with two eyes and body trying to do its mission in Earth. But still without any meaningful dialogue, Wall-E is able to reflects more emotions, charachter development (by using just motions of eyes and body) than most of films. I guess, that is not nothing but quite unique example of storytelling. Not just storytelling, story in Wall-E is also interesting and valueable in terms of message it carries from start to end. Earth is full of trash, humanity lost its identity because of addiction to technology-convenience, importance and meaning of a life and more. 

Just briefly, I think this animation is a product come out from creative, innovator and passionate minds. Nowadays, unfortunately I can not see such animations so much thats another why Wall-E is unique and will remain so.


**Arrival**

While saying sci-fi movies, most of people thinks of movies such as Interstellar,2001 Space Odyssey, Star Wars. Altough they are also pretty good movies, I think *Arrival* is not well-known and a bit underrated movie. Actually I am not sure also Arrival is completely belong to sci-fi genre. For me, its cover is seems quite sci-fi but it is about importance of communication and how communication affects our understanding of surroundings and time. This is actually what differs Arrival from its counterparts: It uses sci-fi objects like aliens, spaceships as a tool to tell a tragedy of a charachter,mother.  

Altough pace of movie is slow, it is not boring because what you see (cinematography) or hear (especially, sound design!) in movie is amazing. Movie uses sounds to support scenes cleverly and masterfully. Here is my favorite [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InyT9Gyoz_o). Another What I like also about Arrival is finally but really finally Aliens do not come to earth to conququer or to fight people.   


**Truman Show**

 I dont know what I can say about Truman Show without giving spoilers. But I want to mention it since script of Truman Show might be best I've seen. Unparallel, bizarre and paranoid. I remember that while watching Truman Show first time. I shocked so many times and asked such questions: Why, what happened, who are they?. Reasons isn't that movie is not understandable and complex, I asked because I am fascinated by world which movie created. Then I watched it over and over again and everytime I could find new perspectives, details. Thats why probably Truman Show is a movie I've watched most.

If anyone is interested, I recommend to watch movie without looking subject and trailer of the movie. Thus, you will also wonder how to be sure you do not spend your live like Truman Burbank. And p
