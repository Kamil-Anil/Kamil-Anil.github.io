>"*we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.*" (Truman Show)

Here, to make this website more personal:) With my personal comments, I want to share some movies, books and everything else which I am impressed and I would like to talk about. Of course, since personal tastes changes with new experiences, I am planning make updates from time to time. And I'm always open for any suggestions, idea or valuable comments. For that you can contact me via my [mail](kamilanil15@gmail.com)  

Movies
======

**WALL-E**
One of my favorite animated movies of all time! Over the years I have watched couple times, and everytime Wall-E's storytelling style really impresses me. About first 30-40 minutes, there is no even single dialogue in movie, just one single robot with two eyes and body trying to do its mission in Earth. But still without any meaningful dialogue, Wall-E is able to reflects more emotions, charachter development (by using just motions of eyes and body) than most of films. I guess, that is not nothing but quite unique example of storytelling. Not just storytelling, story in Wall-E is also interesting and valueable in terms of message it carries from start to end. Earth is full of trash, humanity lost its identity because of addiction to technology-convenience, importance and meaning of a life and more.
