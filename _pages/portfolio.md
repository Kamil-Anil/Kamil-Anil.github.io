Advanced Photonics and Photovoltaics(APP)
======

APP research group is conducted by a professor at METU. This group mosly focuses on researchs about solar cell technologies. I become member of APP as undergraduate researcher in 2022. And through years, I took part in many projects which are stated below:    


**1-ReBTEPP**
*(Reflection Based Thickness Estimator Program Package)*

In that project, MATLAB software was prepared to estimate thickness of material in nanometer scale with high accuracy. For that purpose, theoretical reflection for various thicknesses was obtained from refractive index of material. And by comparing it with measured reflection data, optimum thickness which gives minimum error between theoretical and measured reflection were found. Thus, quite close estimation of thickness of material was achieved.

**2-Optimization of Perovskite Solar Cells for Indoor Applications**

In this study, an opto-electrical simulation-based optimization was performed to improve the efficiency of PSCs under various indoor illumination spectra. Optimization was performed in terms of perovskite thickness and band-gap. Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) was used to produce carrier generation profile for each different indoor illumination. Finally, generation profile was used as input to SCAPS simulation to get electrical performance of perovskite solar cells.

This project was presented in 21st National Optics, Electro-Optics and Photonics Workshop at KOÃ‡ University in 2023. I was first writer and for detailed information our workshop poster could be helpful.


**3-Simple Determination of Optical Constants of Organic Blends**


**4-Simulation Analysis of Perovskite Performance in Space**

Perovskite solar cells, one of the leading contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology , have become attractive options because of their remarkable efficiency and potential. However, there is still much to learn about their dependability and performance in the hostile environment of space. This study aimed to bridge this gap by investigating the performance of perovskite solar cells in space environments.

To do that, I completed SCAPS simulations for different perovskite materials under AM0 spectrum by following methodology showing below:
