Simulation Analysis of Perovskite Performance in Space
======
Perovskite solar cells, one of the leading contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology , have become attractive options because of their remarkable efficiency and potential. However, there is still much to learn about their dependability and performance in the hostile environment of space. This study aimed to bridge this gap by investigating the performance of perovskite solar cells in space environments.

To do that, I completed SCAPS simulations for different perovskite materials under AM0 spectrum.
