Designer Materials and Devices 
======
The Designer Materials and Devices group is housed within Aalto University's Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering. Core topics for this research group are metametarials and metasurfaces.
I participated in this group as research intern during summer of 2023 and I worked on permittivity measurements of 3D printing materials.

**Permittivity Measurements of 3D Printing Materials**


As a research intern at Aalto University, I experienced closely the research methodology of a scientist and I found a chance to apply this methodology myself. During first month of my internship, I made field research to find previous studies related to my project. I improved my theoretical background and at the same time,  I got used to researcher's environment and I received laboratory training and I prepared my set-up for measurements.

Advanced Photonics and Photovoltaics(APP)
======

APP research group is conducted by a professor at METU. This group mostly focuses on researchs about solar cell technologies. I become member of APP as undergraduate researcher in 2022. And through years, I took part in many projects which are stated below:    


**1-ReBTEPP**
*(Reflection Based Thickness Estimator Program Package)*

In that project, MATLAB software was prepared to estimate thickness of material in nanometer scale with high accuracy. For that purpose, theoretical reflection for various thicknesses was obtained from refractive index of material. And by comparing it with measured reflection data, optimum thickness which gives minimum error between theoretical and measured reflection were found. Thus, quite close estimation of thickness of material was achieved.

**2-Optimization of Perovskite Solar Cells for Indoor Applications**

Recently, perovskites have also been gaining more interest for indoor applications due to better alignment of their absorption spectrum with indoor illumination

In this study, an opto-electrical simulation-based optimization was performed to improve the efficiency of PSCs under various indoor illumination spectra. Optimization was performed in terms of perovskite thickness and band-gap. Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) was used to produce carrier generation profile for each different indoor illumination. Finally, generation profile was used as input to SCAPS simulation to get electrical performance of perovskite solar cells.

This project was presented in 21st National Optics, Electro-Optics and Photonics Workshop at KOÇ University in 2023. I made a contribution to this research as a "first writer". For detailed information about this study and its results, our [workshop poster](https://kamil-anil.github.io/files/Indoor_Perovskite.pdf) could be helpful.


**3-Simple Determination of Optical Constants of Organic Blends**

In the Organic Solar Cells (OSC), the blend of a donor and an acceptor material is used in the active layer of OSC. Thus, for analysis of OSCs, the determination of optical constants of organic blends is necessary. This determination by sample fabrication and ellipsometry processes is money and time consuming

In this study, a method was introduced for calculation of optical constants of the blends made out of any concentration ratio of donor and acceptor organic materials. This process removes the need for ellipsometry and sample fabrication steps for different blend ratios. The method is based on the the principle of mixtures, in which optical constants of individual materials are scaled according to compositions.

This project was also presented in 21st National Optics, Electro-Optics and Photonics Workshop at KOÇ University in 2023. I was "third writer". Again, if you interest more you can check out our [poster](https://kamil-anil.github.io/files/Poster_OrganicBlends_v1.pdf)



**4-Simulation Analysis of Perovskite Performance in Space**

Perovskite solar cells, one of the leading contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology , have become attractive options because of their remarkable efficiency and potential. However, there is still much to learn about their dependability and performance in the hostile environment of space. This study aimed to bridge this gap by investigating the performance of perovskite solar cells in space environments.

To do that, I completed SCAPS simulations for different perovskite materials under AM0 spectrum by following methodology showing below:
