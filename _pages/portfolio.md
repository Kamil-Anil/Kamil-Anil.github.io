ReBTEPP
======
(Reflection Based Thickness Estimator Program Package)

In that project, as a team of undergraduate researchers, we aimed preparing a MATLAB software to estimate thickness of material in nanometer scale with high accuracy. For that purpose, we obtained theoretical reflection for various thicknesses from refractive index of material. And we compared it with measured reflection data to find optimum thickness which gives minimum error between theoretical and measured reflection. Thus, we succeed to estimate thickness of material.

Simulation Analysis of Perovskite Performance in Space
======
Perovskite solar cells, one of the leading contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology , have become attractive options because of their remarkable efficiency and potential. However, there is still much to learn about their dependability and performance in the hostile environment of space. This study aimed to bridge this gap by investigating the performance of perovskite solar cells in space environments.

To do that, I completed SCAPS simulations for different perovskite materials under AM0 spectrum by following methodology showing below:
