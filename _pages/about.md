>"*I am still learning.*" (Michelangelo, age 87)

I am a senior year (4th grade) Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Middle East Technical University in Ankara/Turkey. I'm enthuastic about mathematics, fields of electromagnetic and communication. I am passionate to participate and do research in related fields.

Below you can find my academic journey, professional & volunteer experience, also you can reach my research experience from [Research tab](https://kamil-anil.github.io/portfolio/), my resume from [CV tab](https://kamil-anil.github.io/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf) and my personal interest-hobbies from [Hobbies tab](https://kamil-anil.github.io/talks/)

Academic Journey
======
I completed my high school education at Trabzon Science High School and  Halil Kale Science High School. After high school, I chose to pursue my education in Departments of Electrical & Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU). In my first year at university, I finished English Preparation School. Upon learning academic english, I started to my undergraduate studies. I developed interest and enthusiasm about fields of electromagnetics and communication theory. Moreover, I am fascinated by mathematics and to learn more deeply it I enrolled in mathematics double major program.

During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in various research projects and technical projects related to my specilizations. I participated in [Advanced Photonics and Photovoltaics](http://app.mnt.metu.edu.tr/) research group. I worked on solar cell technology and performed some simulations.Furthermore, I completed my second internship as researcher at Aalto University in Finland . There, I experienced different culture, and I did research for 3 months. Thus, that wonderful experience improved my ability of working in different work environments, and communication skills. In that research group "[Designer Materials and Devices](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-electronics-and-nanoengineering/designer-materials-and-devices)" I performed measurements in labs for finding permittivity of materials commonly used in 3D printing. 

For detailed information about my researchs, you can visit [Research tab](https://kamil-anil.github.io/portfolio/)

Currently, I am senior year student at my university. After graduating, I am planning to continue my academic journey with Master program to gain deeper understanding of communication and electromagnetics.




Professional Experience 
======

**NETAŞ Telecommunication:**
In summer of 2022, I did my first internship at "NETAŞ Telecommunication" company in Technocity of METU. I experienced professional office environment at first time and I wrote Python code and I designed messaging application with GUI by using Apache Kafka Servers. Through my internship, I investigated basic communication protocols and server systems. 

**Designer Materials and Devices:**
In 2023, I completed my second internship via erasmus program. I participated research group at Aalto University in Finland for 3 months and I worked on permittivity measurements of 3D manufactured materials. During this internship, I gained experience in research methodology, including field research, measurements, and simulation techniques. 

First month, I searched articles related to my research and I learned lab environment and measurement set-up. Second month, I performed measurements of different materials for 3D printing to extract S-Parameters of materials in wide-frequency range by using various type wave-guides. Third month, I conducted simulation work by using HFSS to analyze and interpret data obtained from measurements. 



Volunteering
------
I am interested in teaching and sharing of positive science and I am trying to attach importance to dissemination of science. For this purpose, I took part in some volunteer activities.

**TEDxMETUAnkara:**
I was member of ODTU-Arge: TEDxMETUAnkara students community at my own university between 2019 and 2021. As community, we organized "[TEDxMETUAnkara: YAPBOZ](https://www.tedxmetuankara.com/2020-yapboz)" event in 2020. I contributed to preparation of "YAPBOZ" by helping to promote the event in social media team. As a consequence, our event has attached great attention and has been widely appreciated. 

If you are interested, you can watch "[TEDx Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKHehwCDMp4&list=PLK-RSL-AUXTA9l3MmlhjUukMGBo0DNVKR&index=1)" in our event. 

**Matematiksel:**
I am currently one of volunteer writer of "[matematiksel](https://www.matematiksel.org/)" website. This website was founded in 2015 and since that time, members of "matematiksel" has contributed to increase interest in mathematics, popular science and general culture. I became member in 2019 and  voluntarily , I write some writings related to my academic interests, books, hobbies, and basically everything which I find valuable to share. 

My writings can be seen in [Author:Kamil Anıl Işık](https://www.matematiksel.org/author/k-anil/)







Special Thanks
------
I am aware of that any achievement which I stated above is not just up to me. They are all also belong to my family, friends, and professors. Thus, I want to say "thank you" to all of them.
